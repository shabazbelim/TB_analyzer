This is a prototype for an online tool that can look at a chest x-ray and tell if a person has Tuberculosis (TB) or not. 

The dataset used to train the model consists of 800 images, which is quite small. Although the accuracy and F1 score are greater than 0.8, I'm uncertain of how well this model will generalize. Therefore, at the moment this is more of an experiment than something that can be used in the real world.

Model F1 score: 0.81

The process used to build and train the model is described in this Kaggle kernel:<br>

The dataset used for the training can be found here:<br>

demo can be found in .ipython file. To fun demo => click on kernal and select restart and run all cells => wait while code is ready => select x-ray and click analyize button.
